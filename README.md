DEFINE THE TERM FUNDAMENTALS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
<br>
The term entrepreneurship came from the French word entre- implies “between”, and prendre-implies “to take”. The term describes people
<br>
who take on the risk between users and sellers or who undertake a task such as starting a new business. Entrepreneurship is the art of
<br>
turning an idea into a business. The entrepreneur is an individual who pursues opportunities irrespective of the resources they own.
<br>

THE COMMON MYTHS ABOUT ENTREPRENEURS
<br>
The view about entrepreneurs and what motivates them to start a business or develop their ideas is on an increase. The misconceptions
<br>
are growing high as media covering on young entrepreneurs who obtain venture capital to fund small business that they grow into a
<br>
multimillion-dollar company. These 21st century entrepreneurs are exceptions rather than the norm and their success is as a result of
<br>
carefully executing an appropriate plan that will commercialize their solid business idea.
<br>
Below are the most common myths and the realities about entrepreneurs:
<br>
Myth 1: entrepreneurs are born, not made: this myth is based on the mistaken belief that some are genetically predisposed to be
<br>
entrepreneurs. The psychological and sociological makeup of entrepreneurs is that entrepreneurs are not genetically different from othe
<br>
r people. That is no one is “born” to be an entrepreneur and that everyone has the potential to become one. Some of the personality
<br>
traits and characteristics associated with entrepreneurs evolve from our environment, life experiences and personal choices backed by
<br>
our social context.
